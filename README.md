Welcome to the Python Plotting Tutorial!

Alongside this file, the tutorial consists of folders that represent each step, indexed in the order they should be completed (step1, then step2, etc.). Within each folder, youâ€™ll find a guide and theoretical explanation of what you need to do (taskX.md), a file where you should write your solution (mainX.py), a test file to check your solution (testX.py), and a file with the solution to the given problem (solutionX.py), where X represents the step number. It's recommended to read the theory first, then attempt to solve the task on your own. Only refer to the provided solution at the end to check your code or for help if you get stuck.

Good luck!
